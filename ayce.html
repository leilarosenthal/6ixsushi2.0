    <h2>Fushimi: The Village <a href="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/fushimi-toronto" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;"><img src="photos/yelp.png" style="width: 25px;"></a></h2>

    <p>Fushimi is easily the best AYCE sushi in Toronto (that I have been to so far at least!) They have great service and some of the best salmon nigiri I've ever had. The menu has a lot of variety, and the a la carte menu isn't too shabby either (if you don't feel like eating 30 pieces in one sitting!) The first time we went was on New Years Day 2016 - the place we wanted to go to wasn't answering the phone and we presumed them closed. So we called up Fushimi and they answered on the first ring (a New Year's Day Miracle!) we got there and we were <strong>stoked</strong>. The restaurant itself could pass as a more upscale place, and the service is so good that a waitor picked my scarf off the floor within seconds of it happening. Anyway, you won't be let down, but I still have a lot of the menu to try.</p>

  <h2>Spring Sushi <a href="https://www.yelp.ca/biz/spring-sushi-toronto" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;"><img src="photos/yelp.png" style="width: 25px;"></a></h2>

    <p>Went in with pretty low expectations, but boy was I surprised. Went one on one with a girlfriend, we started with fresh sushi and sashimi, with soups and salads. The salad was great cause they added cucumber and tomoato, instead of just giving you 3 pieces of iceberg and a scoop full of dressing. We then ordered some rolls, loved the red dragon cause it was shrimp instead of crab, and of course I liked the spicy salmon roll, even though it was pretty kinda dense. My friend had the rainbow roll and the california and finished all of them; I was thoroughly impressed. We kept it simple, but also ordered these mini sushi pizzas and spicy salmon nigiri. Definitely want to go back with more people to try more of the menu, but so far a success!</p>

    <p>Went back here again with some friends for lunch - I think the dinner items are higher quality, my friends and I gave it a 6-7 out of 10, which actually isn't bad from an AYCE place in the middle of dundas square for $17. We ordered a ton of food and I have added the pictures here!</p>

    <p><i>Extra perk:</i> drink deals and loud music, for those nights you want to go before heading out</p>
