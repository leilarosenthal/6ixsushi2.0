      <h2>What's trending right now? Sushi Burritos</h2>
        <h3>Fish'd by Edo</h3>
          <p>If you haven't been yet, you must check out the open air food court at Adelaide and Queen. Not only is there Holy Chuck for your burger cravings and the ever so popular rolled ice cream, but also a sushi burrito made my the beloved Toronto favourite, Edo Sushi. I didn't know what to expect, but boy was this delicious. They are using fresh ingredients (wouldn't expect anything less of Edo) and it was the perfect size to not feel uncomfortably full (or as Louis CK would say, eat till you hate yourself). I would absolutely suggest trying this place out for yourself - it's more than just a perfect picture!</p>

        <h3>Sushitto on the Road</h3>
          <p>This is a food truck and BEWARE- there will be lines. There's a lot of speculation as to whether it's worth it to wait for this. I went on a Saturday right at 11:30 when they opened to avoid this. I was honestly disappointed they didn't take cards, being many food trucks these days do, and they didn't advertise it anywhere. However the food was tasty (and messy!) and it was fun for the experience. Try it out for yourself!</p>
