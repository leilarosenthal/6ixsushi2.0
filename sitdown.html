    <p>My favorite spicy salmon roll in the city - they also give you a free brothy soup at the start for free, and the service is great. They have some decent specials for getting fresh sushi and sashimi, but overall the prices are reasonable. Nice sit down restaurant, I like to go there with my boyfriend for a nice night out. Pictured below is just some take out I got after work one night. Here you have the spicy salmon maki, as well as the kamikaze roll (spicy tuna with avocado on top). Both fantastic, both spicy like they should be. </p>

  <p>Mi-Ne. Is. Fan-tas-tic. If you are willing to pay $10+ for a classic roll, you certainly won't regret it. I have never tasted anything here that I didn't like, and everything is extremely fresh. They have locations in Aurora and Markham, in addition to this city place location for all the GTA folks as well. I have nothing else to say besides you have to go try this place if you haven't! Huge shout out to the Spicy Salmon Sashimi - balls of spicy salmon goodness, how can you go wrong?!</p>

  <p>Get the Jessie Special (trust me it's on the secret menu) If you like spicy salmon sushi drenched in spicy mayo, this roll is for you. If you want my special, just go for the 3 sets of rolls with soup and salad for optimal sushi enjoyment - variation and all the crunch. This place will take you by surprise though - honestly when I first looked through their photos I thought the rolls looked a bit sloppy (for lack of a better word) - they just looked kinda weird. BUT, once I started eating them I couldn't get enough. I often crave their sushi but now that winter has hit I'm less likely to walk 40 minutes down bloor. We'll meet again in the spring.</p>

  <p>I have only has Saku for takeout so far (you must be dreaming if you think I can get out to all these places with a group of people who are willing to eat sushi as much as I do! Any takers?!) but anyway, this place doesn't disappoint. I ordered the dynamite roll and spicy salmon and it was the perfect amount of food for dinner. The ingredients are fresh and the favlours are right, and I will definitely be back. I've seen pictures of the chef's special at dinner and it's absolutely beautiful - definitely on my bucket list!</p>

  <p>Sushi on Roncey is plain easy. It is family owned (they even have toys out for kids who come to eat there) and offered everyone at the table free green tea, even for the people not eating. I ordered the lunch special and it was awesome - I got a fresh noodle soup to start, alongside a light salad and a miso - that was just the beginning! I got spicy salmon AND spicy tuna, just felt like a bit of crunch that day I guess (and every other day...) It tasted great and the price was right - if you are ever in Roncesvalles definitely check it out! Cute neighbourhood and cozy place.</p>

  <p>Despite the mediocre Yelp score, this place has continued to impress me. (The half off deal on the weekend might have me a bit biased) but this place is seriously so cheap, has amazing deals, and a pretty good interior. I went in just to grab take-out on the weekend (got Maki special A) and it was more than enough food. I find most maki specials always include a roll that I'm not crazy about, but this place provides good options at great prices. They even gave me a green tea to enjoy while I waited. If you go in to dine, and spend $20, it's literally half off which basically makes it comparable to AYCE *after my heart*</p>

  <p>Came here for lunch with some colleagues, and quite frankly I was a tad disappointed with the portions for the price. Paying $11 for a roll should get you a fair amount! While the quality was pretty good, I expected a bit better. I would probably go back and give it another shot, but I wasn't completely blown away. Check them out for yourself! I tried the spicy salmon roll and a the red dragon, and both hit the spot. Also pictured are some bento boxes which got great reviews as well as a rice-free roll that I tried and it was great, but slippery!</p>
